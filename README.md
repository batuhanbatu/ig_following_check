## _Instagram Following Check by Batuhan Batu_
#
Hi, in this article, I will let you know about how to set up this application and run on your computer.

First of all, your computer needs to have a valid Python version and a virtual environment (may be for an empty project) and program will need 2 html files which I will explain to you how we can have. So, let's start :)

After you have a Python and my project, you need to open your instagram profile from a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)

Then the first step here we will do is to open our "following" list (as shown in the image).

After opening your following list, make sure that scrolling bar of the list is located at the bottom (shown in the image with red arrow).

Then, we make "right" click and save the page in "html" format (shown in the image)

Here you must be sure that the name of the file is "following.html" and located in the same folder with project as shown in the image.

After saving your "following.html" file, it is time to do same operations for your followers, we are opening our followers list.

We again have to be sure that our scrolling bar located at the bottom.

And after that, we make a right click and save this file also in "html" format.

And we have to be sure that the name of the file is "followers.html" and located in the same directory with our project.

After saving second html file, we can run the program and see the results. If you think that program is working wrong, check your lists on Instagram's website :)

By the way, keep in mind that you can use this program for any account that you can reach followers & following list :)

_Thank you so much for reading till here, Hope to see you on next projects.._
